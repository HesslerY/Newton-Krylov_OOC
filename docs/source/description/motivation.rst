The application that motivated the development of Newton-Krylov_OOC is
spinning up biogeochemical tracers in an ocean general circulation model (OGCM).
The target model configuration is multi-year runs with O(10\ :sup:`6-7`) grid points.
Such runs take hours of time on a supercomputer and are typically
done through a batch submission system.

Literature on the topic demonstrates that Newton-Krylov based solvers
can be used effectively to solve this problem
:cite:`Li_Primeau_OceMod_2008,Khatiwala_OceMod_2008`.
An excellent book on Newton-Krylov solvers, :cite:`Kelley_Newtons_Method`,
advises that is is preferable to use an existing Newtonâ€“Krylov
implementation instead of implementing your own.
However, existing implementations of Newton-Krylov solvers have some
features that make their usage impractical for the target model configuration.
