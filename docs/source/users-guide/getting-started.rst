Getting Started
===============

#. Install conda for python 3, if you do not already have it installed.
   This can be done using miniconda, which is
   `available online <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_.
#. Download the software from github, by executing the command:
   ``git clone https://github.com/klindsay28/Newton-Krylov_OOC.git``.
#. Setup the conda environment, Newton-Krylov_OOC, for using the software.
   If you have not done this previously, execute the following command from
   top-level directory of Newton-Krylov_OOC:
   ``conda env create --file conda-env.yaml``.
   If you have done this previously, and updates to Newton-Krylov_OOC
   have updated the file ``conda-env.yaml``, then execute the command
   ``conda env update --file conda-env.yaml``.
#. Activate the environment, by executing the command:
   ``conda activate Newton-Krylov_OOC``.
